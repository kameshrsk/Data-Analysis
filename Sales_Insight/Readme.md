# Sales Data Analysis Project

This repository showcases my data analysis project focused on analyzing sales data to provide valuable insights. The project utilizes Power BI to create a comprehensive report page that highlights total revenue, sales quantity, top customers by revenue, top customers by frequent orders, and sales trends.

## Summary

The Sales Data Analysis Project aims to provide insights into the sales that have occurred and are currently happening. The project utilizes data from a MySQL server and presents the analysis through a Power BI report page.

The report page includes the following visualizations:

- Total revenue: Provides an overview of the overall revenue generated.
- Sales quantity: Displays the total quantity of products sold.
- Top customers by revenue (bar chart): Identifies the customers who have contributed the most revenue.
- Top customers by frequent orders (bar chart): Highlights the customers with the highest number of frequent orders.
- Sales trends (line chart): Depicts the revenue trend over time, with months on the x-axis and revenue on the y-axis. Additionally, it includes a secondary y-axis that shows the count of orders per month.

The report page incorporates a slicer, allowing users to filter the visuals based on different years.
