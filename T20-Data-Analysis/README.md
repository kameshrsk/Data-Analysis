# T20 World Cup Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of players in the recent T20 World Cup and selecting the best 11 players to form a team. The analysis considers various factors such as batting average, strike rate, economy rate, and wickets taken by bowlers to identify the most suitable players for different roles in the team.

## Summary

In this project, I utilized web scraping techniques to gather data from the Cricinfo website, including match summaries, scoreboards, batsmen profiles, and bowlers profiles. The collected data was then cleaned using Power Query in Power BI, ensuring its quality and consistency.

The analysis phase involved creating detailed reports and visualizations using Power BI. I evaluated the performance of openers, middle-order batsmen, and bowlers based on specific criteria and roles. The reports included tables, scatter plots, and performance cards, providing insights into player performance and helping in the selection of the best 11 players.

Additionally, I developed interactive tooltip pages that display player information, including images, names, countries, roles, and batting or bowling styles. These tooltips provide further context when hovering over the scatter plot charts.
